<section> is used in two scenarios: 
When it is placed as the immediate child of <body>, it means major topographical blocks of a page.
When it is placed inside <article>, it means sub-units of an article.
<article> in many cases is semantically more suitable.
When <section> is used, a way to test appropriate usage is to see whether there is a immediate header child element, i.e. H1~6.
@todo test if the section 'doctor' would allow divs before <h1>.
