        <p>GBIF has awarded its prestigious Ebbe Nielsen Prize for 2014 to Tony Rees, whose groundbreaking informatics tools have significantly advanced the delivery of data about life on Earth.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Developing the <a href="http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/">‘c-squares’ spatial index and mapping system</a>, which enables data relating to any position on the Earth’s surface to be expressed in simple, text-based format as a kind of ‘global postcode’. This enables rapid search, retrieval and mapping of georeferenced data such as the results of biodiversity surveys or aggregated species occurrence data.</li>
					<li>A redesign of the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (<a href="http://www.iobis.org">OBIS</a>), introducing centralized taxonomic indexing, spatial indexing and rapid online mapping for the first time. Rees is manager of the Australian node of OBIS.</li>

				<p>Your work in multiple areas of biodiversity informatics has contributed significantly to advances in the delivery of marine data, particularly through OBIS, and contributed fundamental tools for wider use by the global community.</p>

				<blockquote>
				<p>IRMNG in particular has been a tool of enormous importance to GBIF and others in supplying much of the detail for a global taxonomic classification of all life and as high-value taxon trait data in a form which can readily be reused in data validation and to enhance species pages.</p>
